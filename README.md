# To Get this Running for you:
* Put the MySQL database and PHP scripts on a server (or LocalHost)
* Change all PHP scripts' "mysqli_connect" function arguments to match database location (If not LocalHost)
* Change all Activity/Fragments' String links that call PHP scripts so that they match the script locations
